# Rubik's table
## Game overview
### Summary
Rubik's table is a program that allows users to solve a two-dimensional version of the classic Rubik's Cube. The objective is to transform either the rows or columns into a uniform color through cyclic movements.

## Mechanics
### Board Manipulation
Players can achieve the goal of the game by moving rows or columns through cyclic shifts, transforming the board into a uniform color pattern either horizontally or vertically.

### New Game
The program provides an option to start a new game by specifying the size of the board (2×2, 3x3 ,4×4, 6×6). It also recognizes when the game is completed, displaying the number of moves it took the player to win, and automatically starts a new game.
